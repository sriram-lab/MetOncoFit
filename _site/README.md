## MetOncoFit: A Machine Learning Algorithm to Identify Common Biochemical and Topological Attributes of Metabolic Genes Recurrently Dysregulated in Tumors
 MetOncoFit is a data-driven approach that uses biochemical and metabolic attributes to predict tumor differential expression, copy number variation, and patient survival.

## Installation
MetOncoFit is a Python package that takes curated cancer metabolic models to output differential expression, copy number variation, and patient survival classification predictions and ranked metabolic/biochemical feature importances.

We recommend installing MetOncoFit inside a [virtual environment](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/). To install the package, use PyPI:

``` Python
pip install metoncofit
```
